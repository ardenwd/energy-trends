      <h1>Clean energy in the US canâ€™t keep up with growing power demands.</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="article">
      <p>
        In 2025, the US will experience the fastest expansion of the US electric
        grid in generations. This is due to an increase in the energy usage of
        data centers, and the production of Electric Vehicles. In 2023, data
        centers accounted for 4.4% of the total US electricity usage and is
        projected to account for as much as 12.0% by 2028. Electric Vehicles
        account for % and are projected to %.

      <p>At the same time, the supply of clean energy sources is increasing.</p>

        But not enough to keep up with the pace of the increasing demand for
        electricity.

      </div>

      <p>
        While the demand is increasing, it outpaces the deployment of clean
        energy sources, leading to a net increase of global emissions. So the
        supply of non-clean energy sources, such as coal, is projected to
        increase in order to keep up with the demand. Leading to an overall
        increase in (carbon) emissions.
